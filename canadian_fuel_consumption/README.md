# Fuel Consumption in the Canadian Car Fleet

First of several projects in which I apply ML concepts practically to learn how to make make predictive models using, currently, static data. 

In this project in particular I will be using data provided by the canadian government in the following [link](http://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/98f1a129-f628-4ce4-b24d-6f16bf24dd64) to find the answer to questions that need the use of modeling. The library used will be sklearn (scikit-learn) along the essential data modules in python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib...).
